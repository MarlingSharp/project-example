# Cycle 1 - Getting Started

In this phase I will look to establish the basic TypeScript project, draw a shape to the screen and react to keyboard controls. This will require the use of a graphics library designed for the web.

For this phase I will experiment with p5.js, this is designed for interactive visualisations, but has the ability to handle control inputs and seems suitable for a simple game.
