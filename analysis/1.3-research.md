## Doom \(original 90s game\)

### Features I will take

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Weapon Inventory | Variety in gameplay is afforded by having weapons with different areas of effect, damage levels, firing rate. |
| Discrete Levels | I think it's simpler to develop a game with contained levels, than an open world game. It also lends itself to high scoring and speed running |
| Scoring Per Level | Keeps track of the amount of the level you have discovered, including secrets and the percentage of enemies killed. |

### Features I will not take

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Setting of Hell | My game will be rather more abstract, and rather less terrifying. |
| Pixel Art Style | Largely governed by technology limits at the time, I will use polygonal models and realistic physics. |

## Splatoon

### Features I will take

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Fun abstract setting | Whilst this game is an FPS, it doesn't really focus on the violence, the shooting and winning is somewhat more abstract and based around an objective. |
| Discrete Levels | I think it's simpler to develop a game with contained levels, than an open world game. It also lends itself to high scoring and speed running |

### Features I will not take

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Online multiplayer | Netcode for this kind of thing is very complex, I would rather concentrate on the AI |
| Painting Mechanics | This game doesn't really use direct projectiles as weapons, it uses the gun to paint the level. This is a mechanic unique to this game and I will not seek to replicate it. |

## Far Cry

### Features I will take

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Realistic Physics | Most objects in the game can be moved under force of gunfire, player collisions. This allows for all manner of emergent gameplay to occur |
| Level Editor | Make a file format that defines the levels that can be readily edited. |
| Controls | Some aspects of the movement and aiming using mouse & keyboard. |

### Features I will not take

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Story | Far Cry has a heavy narrative, which is not really what this project needs to focus on. |
| Violence | The cut scenes and basic gameplay make for very visceral violence. Whilst fun and often hilarious, is not what I am going to focus on. |
| Immersive Player Model | The players arms, hands and sometimes entire body are sometimes rendered in ways that are highly reactive to the events in the game, whilst this is highly immersive, it is also complex to write and beyond the scope of what I plan to create. |

## Doom 2016 & Doom Eternal

### Features I will take

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Checkpoints | Challenging moments in the levels need checkpoints preceding them, otherwise frequent deaths frustrate the player if they have to repeat a bunch of easy stuff that precedes it. |
| Per Level Score | Grading the player and providing high score table can motivate replays. |

### Features I will not take

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Gear System | The new Doom games have a very complex economy of experience/skill points and various trees of unlocking. It's far more complex that what I will make. I found this aspect rather overwhelming in Doom eternal and I would rather the player focussed on the moment to moment mechanics. |

## Goldeneye

A moment when video game shooters went for a new level of realism, with pickups being from enemies and genuine weapon stashes, rather than magic floating gifts from the gods. This game introduced the concept of objectives beyond just murdering everything in sight.

### Features I will take

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Discrete Levels | Each level has fixed starting gear, nothing is carried over. This allows for the scoring system to have a level playing field. This is justified in game by there being events between the levels. |
| Objectives | Taking pictures, using computers, keeping NPC's safe. This game tried to make the world feel more alive by asking you not to blow every single bit of it up. |
| Minimal HUD | Health only appeared when you took damage, the ammo display was very small. It helped immerse the player in the game. |

### Features I will not take

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Licensed Setting | I will not be using any existing IP \(Like James Bond\) as the basis for the art style or 'story' |
| Story | I will not be writing a story that threads together the levels, it will be more abstract. |
| Multiplayer | I will focus on an arcade single player game. |

## Algorithmic Botany

There are some cool algorithms that demonstrate how plants and trees grow, which I think could form the basis of procedural level generation.

### Features I will take

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Algorithmic growth | The growth of the trees/plants might be a good basis for the generation of ever more complex levels, I will experiment with this. |
| Procedural Generation | The use of algorithms to procedurally generate levels for games has been on the rise for the last decade in games like Spelunky. |

### Features I will not take

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Purely visual | I will be creating physical obstacles and perhaps rendering things differently. |
