The game should run without crashing, whatever the player does.

The game should run at 60fps on the target platform.

| Success Criterion | Justification | Reference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Program doesn't crash with normal play | Player will lose progress if the game crashes, and it interrupts their enjoyment. |  |
| Frame rate 25fps | The algorithms underpinning the game need to be efficient enough to run quickly, slowdown is frustrating for players as it fundamentally alters the rhythm of control inputs. |  |
| Multiplayer can cope with 4 players at once |  |  |
| Fire button causes weapon to discharge | Fundamental mechanic of FPS games, required to complete objectives such as killing all the enemies. |  |
| Picking up ammo should cause ammo count to increase | The player will need to replenish ammo throughout, gives the player the whole mechanic of managing their ammo stock level. |  |
| Enemies should attack player on site | Provides the difficulty of the game, motivates the player to kill the enemy. |  |
| Levels generated are passable | The procedural generation must not generate levels which are impassable given the movement capabilities of the player. |  |
